Hi, my name is Michael! Welcome. This site is a loosely organized aggregation of my life and the things that I care most about. I've outlined some of those here.

## Faith

The single most important development in my life has been the decision to follow Christ. I fully believe that God graciously saved me from a life of unchecked sin and brokenness, and that He is transforming me day-by-day into the man He wants me to be.

I did not grow up in a religious household, and spent the first ~20 years of my life wavering between spiritual apathy and firm atheism. I ultimately pursued my own gratification and pleasure at every turn, and had countless broken relationships with friends, significant others, and family. Almost always I was the one at fault for that brokenness. In college, I chose to enter into a dizzying maze of substance abuse, status-chasing, and selfishly impure relationships with women.

By the grace of God, when I was at my lowest point, an Uber driver named Tonya shared the gospel with me - and the story of the cross resonated in such a way that it never had before. Shortly after, I was unexpectedly thrown into a community of like-minded believers who also desired to chase after Christ. I was quickly freed from most of the self-destructive behaviors that had characterized my life to that point. I became confident in both my immediate future, and my eternity. I started to heal, despite having scars that I will carry with me for a while.

The friendships I've made in this new season of life have been some of the most life-giving relationships that I can remember. I got involved in a student ministry during my senior year called <a href="https://stumo.org">Student Mobilization</a>, which grew me in countless ways. Jason Kuhlman, the former director of UT StuMo, spent innumerable hours investing in me as a man of God. I am forever indebted to him. I spent two years living with a wonderful group of Christian men (Moe, MSG, Nick, TCol, and JP) who challenged me, encouraged me, and bonded with me deeper than any other friendships I've had. Unexpectedly, new life was breathed into the relationship between me and my childhood best friend Thomas, who is now pursuing Christ in Charlotte, NC - we are closer now than we ever have been. These friendships, and so many more, give me constant encouragement over the power that the gospel brings to relationships.

As of 2019, I've been a member of <a href="https://redeemerpres.org">Redeemer Presbyterian Church</a> in Austin, where I have been blessed abundantly with fellowship, wise counsel, and regular spiritual nourishment. Before this, I was a partner at the <a href="https://austinstone.org/">Austin Stone</a>'s downtown campus. These two institutions have been profoundly impactful in my walk, and I am grateful for them both.

</figure>

My life's sole purpose, although lived out imperfectly, is to glorify the Lord in all that I do and to help build the kingdom here on earth. I am nothing but a redeemed man in Christ, and I owe every gift that I have to God. I hope to dedicate at least some of the posts here to the Lord - whether that looks like sharing some more of my personal testimony, writing some extremely-amateur biblical commentary, or philosophizing about how the Christian worldview applies to current events.

## Tech

My interest in tech really took off in college, when I made the impressively foolish decision to drop out my junior year and form a FinTech startup called Vest Technologies. The idea was to mimic the superior (and very cool) algorithmic trading systems of some of the high-performing quant funds (like Jim Simons' <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/how-jim-simons-founder-of-renaissance-technologies-beats-the-market.html">Medallion fund</a>), and make our fund accessible to non-accredited investors via a Robinhood-like user platform. Said startup crashed and burned after a few tumoltuous months. I *vastly* overestimated my abilities, handled finances very poorly, and was in a not-so-great place in life. However, I scratched the surface of several cool frontiers - trading algorithms with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>; mind-boggling alternative financial data with <a href="https://www.quandl.com/">Quandl</a> APIs; mobile interface development with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>; and the game-changing concept of cloud computing on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. These topics were totally fascinating, and I felt strongly that I needed to pursue some form of a career in tech.

</figure>

After facing the reality that I was *not* going to be the next Zuckerberg-esque billionaire (womp womp), I re-enrolled in school. I decided to abandon my finance major, and pivoted to the most tech-oriented program that the McCombs School of Business had to offer - Management Information Systems (MIS). I had the great pleasure of learning from professors that challenged my overconfidence, opened my eyes up to new ways of thinking, and taught me how to efficiently learn things on my own.

### My first job...

I was blessed with a job offer after graduation at a small consulting firm called <a href="https://headspring.com">Headspring</a>. It was here where rubber really started to meet the road. Headspring graciously invested 6 weeks to intensively train my class of junior consultants in all things .NET. This was led by one of the smartest developers I have ever come across, Patrick Lioi (pictured on the far right). 

<figure>

</figure>

After training, I got a desk that was located right next to <a href="https://jimmybogard.com/">Jimmy Bogard</a>, one of the most well-known figures in the .NET world. I got to soak up troves of wisdom by overhearing his architectural calls with big-name clients. I was also blessed to be under the supervision of two incredible tech leads in my project work, Ben Boehme and Kurt Johnson. Ben is pictured next to me in the basketball photo, and Kurt is pictured with me at a Texas football game. These men not only helped me grow in my career, but invested their time to form a genuine relationship with me.

My Headspring coach/mentor, Matt Siegel, challenged me regularly to be *excellent* at my job and was unafraid to tell me the areas where I could improve. A few of the older Christian men at the company abundantly provided me with wise counsel and spiritual fellowship. The way all these factors came together convinced me that this career was meant to be my calling. Not to sound sappy, but the relationships were by far the best part. Headspring has permanently etched itself a place in my heart, and I am incredibly grateful for all they've provided me.

### My next chapter...

In mid-2020, I was offered an exciting new opportunity with <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology/solutions/application-modernization.html">Deloitte's Application Modernization Studio</a>. This team was originally a German startup that was acquired by Deloitte in 2017, and they had several lofty initiatives that were just starting during the time of my interviews - moving from SVN to git; migrating to AWS; and expanding their .NET expertise. The prospect of helping an organization with these efforts from the ground-up was impossible for me to turn down. My official title is "Build Engineer", but I have been given plenty of autonomy and trust to get my hands dirty with several different topics - including some .NET development, which is admittedly still my favorite. So far I am enjoying the experience of working for a big, multi-national firm that has its hands in almost everything. I've been blessed here with awesome mentors and co-workers, both in Germany and in Austin, who truly care about my success. I'm genuinely excited for what the future holds here. For those of you that are interested, I have attached a short video on what the Studio does at a high level.

<br />

My passion for software development has grown to be much more than something that pays the bills. I am pursuing a Masters in Computer Science degree through Arizona State (go Sun Devils) in my free time. I earned my Associate AWS Solutions Architect certification in college, and am currently studying for the Docker Certified Associate exam. I'm regularly thinking of personal project concepts, although I must confess, far too many of which have not progressed beyond the idea phase. My current side-project, <a href="https://github.com/michaelhwillingham/NBAProject.Blazor">NBAProject.Blazor</a>, is early in the development lifecycle. I think Blazor is going to be one of the most influential frameworks in the next few years, and wanted to turn this opinion into a proof-of-concept. I'm a believer in my responsibility to contribute back to the development community that gives so freely, and I will try to leverage the bulk of my content here to do just that.

## Sports

I'll keep this part short. I follow these teams with a fiery passion:
* The Texas Longhorns (football & men's basketball)
* The Dallas Mavericks
* The Pittsburgh Steelers
* The Gooners (Arsenal)

The proudest accomplishment to date* is <a href="https://texas.forums.rivals.com/threads/flight-tracking-alert.501401/">my thread on Orangebloods</a>, which racked up 32,000 views and orchestrated the wild Urban Meyer to Texas flight-tracking saga of Winter 2020. It was piping <a href="https://www.outkick.com/urban-meyer-horseshoe-bay-texas-resort-fox-sport/">hot news</a> for about a week.

I also believe that Luka will win MVP this year, and I'm willing to die on that hill. Want to know stats about the Mavs running a historically efficient offense last year? I'm your guy.

 In general - if your sporting interests align with any of the fine organizations I've listed off, we will probably be friends.

Outside of just watching sports, I actively try to play basketball as much possible. It was my central out-of-school activity for many years growing up, and the sport has been an important part of my life. From my recent, <a href="https://leagues.uhlife.com/profile_career.aspx?RegionID=10&SeasonDivisionID=3220&PlayerID=34170">statistically *dominant***</a> 2019 season playing with Life Time, I think it is fair to say that I've still got it.

<br />
<small>DISCLAIMERS:</small>
<br />
<br />
<small>* To my parents and any future spouse/children/employers, I am only kidding about the flight tracking thing being my proudest accomplishment.</small>
<br />
<br />
<small>** Maybe "dominant" is a stretch. My stat line is 0.0 points per game, 0.8 rebounds per game, 0.3 assists per game, and 0.3 turnovers per game. Highlights include shooting 2 three-pointers during my career and missing them both. One was a <em>nasty</em> airball.</small>
<br />

## Hobbies

My primary hobbies outside of tech and sports include exploring the outdoors (namely via hiking and skiing), homebrewing beer, dishing out political hot takes to my friends, nerding out on history, and being a self-nominated *elite* movie-picker and Spotify playlist-maker. If I have anything neat to share in these regards, I'll be sure to post it here.

If you actually cared enough to read to this point, you're a trooper. I appreciate it.
